# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Any changes to Jeff should focus on solving a problem that users of Jeff are having.
This section should explain this problem in detail, including necessary background.

It should also contain several specific use cases where this feature can help a user, and explain how it helps.
This can then be used to guide the design of the feature.

This section is one of the most important sections of any RFC, and can be lengthy.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already part of the Jeff specification and you were teaching it to another Jeff user. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Jeff users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Jeff. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample migration guidance or deprecation guidance.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. schema changes), this section should focus on how Jeff users should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Implementation-level explanation
[implementation-level-explanation]: #implementation-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- It is clear what changes should be made to the Jeff specification.
- It is reasonably clear how the Jeff libraries should be updated to expose the feature.
- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is a schema change, how common is the use case and how likely is it to be used by other users?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For schema changes: Does this feature exist in other program formats or representations and what experience have their community had?
- For projects/community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects and communities, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other formats.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that Jeff sometimes intentionally diverges from common program representations.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before release?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be
and how it would affect the project in a holistic way. Try to use this section
as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the format in
your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
