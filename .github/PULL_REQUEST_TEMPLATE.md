<!--
  -- Thanks for contributing to `jeff`!
  --
  -- We require PR titles to follow the Conventional Commits specification,
  -- https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/. This helps us generate
  -- changelogs and follow semantic versioning.
  --
  -- Start the PR title with one of the following:
  --  * `feat:` for new features
  --  * `fix:` for bug fixes
  --  * `refactor:` for code refactors
  --  * `docs:` for documentation changes
  --  * `test:` for test changes
  --  * `perf:` for performance improvements
  --  * `revert:` for reverting changes
  --  * `rfc:` for RFCs
  --  * `ci:` for CI/CD changes
  --  * `chore:` for changes that don't fit in any of the above categories
  -- The last two categories will not be included in the changelog.
  --
  -- If your PR includes a breaking change, please add a `!` after the type
  -- and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` line in the body of the PR describing
  -- the necessary changes for users to update their code.
  --
  -- If your PR is an RFC, please follow the RFC process outlined in the
  -- `rfcs/README.md` document.
