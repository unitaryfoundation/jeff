# *jeff* program examples

This directory contains a collection of *jeff* programs generated from other languages.
See each subdirectory's README for more information.

Run `encode_examples.sh` to re-generate the binary `.jeff` files from the text descriptions.
You will need to have `capnp` installed, as described in the [development guide][DEVELOPMENT].
